## What you'll accomplish:

- Deploy the enhanced controller image with full Lua dependencies
- Configure Arxignis environment variables and settings
- Set up high ports (8080/8444) for sandbox compatibility
- Deploy a demo application with Ingress routing
- Validate the complete integration architecture

## Prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster (provided by KillerCoda)
- Basic knowledge of kubectl commands
- Understanding of Kubernetes Ingress concepts
